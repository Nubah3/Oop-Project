Temperature Converter

A simple Java program demonstrating object-oriented programming principles for temperature conversion. The program allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit. The modular design encapsulates temperature units as classes, and an interface ensures consistent conversion methods. The user-friendly console interface prompts users for input and provides conversion results. Additionally, the program writes the conversion result to a file named "output.txt."

Features

User-friendly Interface: The program prompts users to input the temperature unit to convert from, the temperature value, and the unit to convert to.
